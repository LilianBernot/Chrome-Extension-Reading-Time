This a personla project I created, to try working with Chrome Extensions.

It provides data on the supposed needed time to read a Wikipedia article.

A second feature is the "toggle references" button, that hides the References section, as I have noticed that for some wikipedia pages, the references are longer than the article in itself.

It's my first time working on Chrome Extensions but also with JavaScript.
