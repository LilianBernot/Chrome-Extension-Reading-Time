This a personal project I created, to try working with Chrome Extensions. It's my first time working on Chrome Extensions but also with JavaScript.

The goal of the extension is to provide data on the needed time to read a Wikipedia article.

A second feature is the "toggle references" button, that hides the References section, as I have noticed that for some wikipedia pages, the references are longer than the article in itself.

The project handles the following languages : 
- English
- Spanish
- French
- Deutsch

You can see in the Issues of the project a better description for why is it not fully available for other languages.
